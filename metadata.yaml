description: Written when the author was in her early twenties, and now regarded as
  Yonge's first serious work of fiction, Abbeychurch grapples with both serious theological
  issues pertaining to the schism between Broad, High and Low factions in the Church
  of England, as well as with the struggles of ego and impulse that are common in
  adolescence and early adulthood. A gripping and sophisticated example of women's
  nineteenth-century fiction.
